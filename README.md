# Community Information Management System
This repository is a part of the SWE573 class.

## Brief
The system is a social platform that allows people to create their communities and interact. Users can create and manage communities, each with unique names, descriptions, and privacy settings. Users can engage with posts and comments, with moderation capabilities to ensure content quality. The system prioritizes user engagement by recommending recent and personalized content and promoting new and low-engaged communities.
